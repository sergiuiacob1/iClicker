\section{Comment résoudre le problème}
Mention exactly what the ``problem'' is: being able to accurately track one's eyes in order to move the cursor.
TL;DR: Will try to tackle this problem as a Machine Learning problem.\\
Why is Machine Learning suitable for this?\\
\subsection{Les réseaux de neurones}
Mention general things about neural networks and why they work well with images.\\

\section{Strategie}
\subsection{Nécessités pour l'apprentissage automatique}
Data. Bad data, bad algorithm. Good data, good algorithm.\\

Data processing. No data processing, no benefits. Good data processing, better algorithm.\\

\subsection{Perceptrons multicouches}
Will try to work with these and see how they act.\\

\subsection{Réseau neurones convolutifs}
Will try to work with these and see how they act.\\
Mention why these might be better for images.\\

\subsection{Recherche d'autres méthodes}
Will make some research to see other state of the art methods for solving problems similar to the one I have.\\
