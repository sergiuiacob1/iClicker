\section{Conditions requises}
Technical requirements: Every technology previously mentioned \ref{technologies-used} should be installed \\

Currently only tested on MacOS, possible that Windows will give errors. Linux should work\\

Link github repository here and mention install instructions.\\

\section{Limites}
Some of the \emph{CURRENT} limits are (current because more will appear, probably):
App only tested with 1 monitor.\\
If setup has multiple cameras, it chooses the first one it finds.\\
Mention training data collection: only me. I wear no glasses.\\
Emphasize on wearing glasses: might not work. To test this.\\

Mention necessity of good lighting.\\

Might only work on MacOS and Linux right now (will test to be sure).
